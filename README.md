# DragAndSnap
![](https://github.com/ctkerns/DragAndSnap/blob/main/Drag%20and%20Snap%20Social.png)
Godot 4 in-game drag and drop functionality for 3D objects with customizable snapping system.

For usage, see the [Getting Started](./docs/Getting%20Started.md) page.

The desired aim of this project is to create a tool that is both easy to use right out of the gate, but abstract enough to be applicable for countless users. It is to support the most obvious usage with as little setup as possible, while allowing customization options for narrower use cases.

If you find this type of feature useful, you are welcome to help contribute!
